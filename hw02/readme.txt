Homework 2

File gpioLEDS.py uses pins "P9_11","P9_13","P9_15", and "P9_17" as inputs for the button presses and uses pins "P9_12","P9_14","P9_16","P9_18" for the output leds. When running hit enter to quit.

File main.py is the etch-a-sketch program. It uses "P9_11","P9_13","P9_15","P9_17", and "P9_18" as the inputs and requires no arguments to start, but prompt the user to suplly the grid size, then it will run a curses window to constantly refreash the display. Hitting any key will stop the program.

For this homework I just modified my previous homework assignment to work with the adafruit python libary. This libary does seem to be missing some handy features (like callbacks) so I might have to switch to java script later on, but untill then I will keep using python.
