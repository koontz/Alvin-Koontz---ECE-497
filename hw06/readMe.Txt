This program is ran with main.py, uses outputs P9_11, P9_13, P9_15, and P9_17 to drive the 
stepper motor. Uses P9_18 as the input from the button to start the program. P9_39 is the 
left IR detecter, and P9_40 is the right. I dont think there really is anything special about 
my program to note on. But i have noticed that the intial steps on the stepper motor 
sometimes mess up and dont move the right amount. Also the IR sensors are a bet lack luster 
but the real time tracking can deal with it.
